# Down Syndrome Detection

**This system was developed to test the Down syndrome testing in kids by image classification.**

:black_nib: Eventhough the dataset is small, for future works , a large dataset can be used to get more advanced results and can train the model.

:computer: used languages : Python

ðŸ“– sample : ![output](https://github.com/SankaVaas/Down_Syndrome/assets/76552743/fa884076-9afa-4dd6-be11-7ef992a0342b)

ðŸ“ˆ I trained the model for 10 epochs just to reduce the amount of time for testing. But I recommend doing it for 100 epochs. 
Here is the result I got.
